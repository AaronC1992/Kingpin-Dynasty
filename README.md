3. For multiplayer, see **Running the Server** below

### Running the Server

```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

For online multiplayer with friends, see `NGROK_SETUP.md`

## 🔧 Configuration & Balancing

### Game Balance
All balancing values are centralized in `config/balance.js`:
- Job payouts and risks
- XP and progression curves  
- Energy costs and regeneration
- Jail mechanics
- Faction mission rewards

**To adjust difficulty:** Edit values in `config/balance.js` - detailed comments explain each parameter.

### World Persistence
The multiplayer server uses `world-state.json` to persist:
- Territory control
- City events
- Leaderboard rankings

This file is automatically created and updated by the server.
